# The Cocktails Database

<h3> What is it? </h3>
The application fetches an external cocktails API and generates a user interface for the user to browse. 
The user is able to search for specific drinks. When clicked, each drink will have its own page with instructions on how to make it. 
The search bar works dynamically by filtering the data with each user input.
This was made was a side project over the weekend. 

<h3> Why this API? </h3>
While I have very little interest in drinks (coffee/tea are my love language), I found this API to be super reliable and provides very good information. 
It also, at times, structures data in a funny way which was a great learning experience.
